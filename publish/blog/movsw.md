![[Pasted image 20241221193308.png]]]Moves the byte, word, or doubleword specified with the second operand (source operand) to the location specified with the first operand (destination operand). Both the source and destination operands are located in memory. The address of the source operand is read from the DS:ESI or the DS:SI registers (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction, 32 or 16, respectively). The address of the destination operand is read from the ES:EDI or the ES:DI registers (again depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction). The DS segment may be over-ridden with a segment override prefix, but the ES segment cannot be overridden.
