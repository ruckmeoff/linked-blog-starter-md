- In a sentence: registers are small storage locations in a CPU that's used to hold temporary data during execution.

## General purpose registers

- **EAX**
	- Purpose: The [[Accumulator register]]
	- Common usage: Used for arithmetic operations (add, sub, mul) and to store calculations results
	- Examples:
	`mov eax, 15 ; loads 15 into EAX register
	`add eax, 15 ; EAX register now holds 30


- **EBX**
	- Purpose: The **Base register**
	- Common usage: Used as a pointer to data in memory or also for arithmetic purposes
	- Examples:
	`mov ebx, 0x6D616C636F7265 ; loads the memory address 0x6D616C636F7265 into EBX 


- **ECX**
	- Purpose: The **Counter** register
	- Common usage: Used as a loop counter or for string/memory operations
	- Example:
	`mov ecx, 10      ; load 10 in ec
	`loop_start:      ; create a loop
	`dec ecx          ; decrement from ecx (ecx = ecx - 1)`
	`jnz loop_start   ; jump to the start of the loop and remove if ecx != 0


- **EDX**
	- Purpose: The **Data** register
	- Common usage: Works with **eax** register for multiplication/division and holds parts of large results/data
	- Example:
	`mov eax, 20       ; loads 20 in eax
	`mov edx, 4        ; loads 4 into edx
	`mul edx           ; multiply eax by edx
